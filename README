Find parents
>>>>>Target
616 is the haploid, it's parnets maybe TS2xTS1 or TS523xTS177, find who is it's parents.
Call their SNP and compare their results of SNP, the most similar is parents of 616.


>>>>>Structure of the Source
0. Build index files of reference genome
1. Single sample maping, sort, rmove duplicate, build index after remove duplicate, call SNP
2. Combine gvcf, convert to vcf, export SNP as a table filei
   Combine gvcf files of 616, TS-2, TS-1
   Combine gvcf files of 616, TS-523, TS-177
3. Calculate their similarity
